# The Rust eBookshelf

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rams3s/rust-ebookshelf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rams3s/rust-ebookshelf)

This [project](https://rams3s.github.io/rust-ebookshelf) aims at providing the community with nightly builds of all official rust mdbooks in epub format.
It is born out of the difficulty I encountered when starting my rust apprenticeship to find recent ebook versions of the official documentation.
